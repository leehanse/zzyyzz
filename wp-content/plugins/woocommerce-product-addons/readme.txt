== Usage ==

1. Edit a product and look for the 'Product Addons' write panel in the sidebar. 

2. Click "+ Add New Product Add-on"

3. Enter a title, description, and select a type for the addon group. 

4. Just below those options click the 'add' button to add a row. Enter a label and (optional) price for the addon.

The addons will then appear on the frontend. Customers will be able to select the addons when adding the product to their cart. Addons will appear on order emails and in the orders admin.
