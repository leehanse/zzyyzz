A WordPress plugin that alters the position and behavior of the Publish button, making it stick to the top of the page when scrolling down the page

== Description ==

Floating Publish Button is perfect especially for editors who use the page and post editing interfaces more than regular administrators.

They'll find this plugin extremely useful, since there won't be any need to scroll up and hit Publish/Save every time they want to update the post, especially if it's a really long post or a page with lots of metaboxes.

If this behavior is annoying for some users, it can easily be turned off from the user's backend profile page.
