Allows running fully multilingual e-commerce sites using WooCommerce and WPML.

== Description ==

This 'glue' plugin makes it possible to run fully multilingual e-commerce sites using [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/) and [WPML](http://wpml.org). It makes products and store pages translatable, lets visitors switch languages and order products in their language.

= Features =

* Lets you translate different kinds of WooCommerce product types
* Central management for translating product categories, tags and custom attributes
* Automatically synchronizes product variations and images
* Keeps the same language through the checkout process
* Sends emails to clients and admins in their selected language
* Allows inventory tracking without breaking products into languages
* Enables running a single WooCommerce store with multiple currencies

= Usage Instructions =

For step by step instructions on setting up a multilingual shop, please go to [WooCommerce Multilingual Manual](http://wpml.org/documentation/related-projects/woocommerce-multilingual/) page.

After installing, go to WPML->WooCommerce Multilingual. The 'General settings' tab will let you translate the store pages and report what taxonomy requires translation.

Then, continue to the 'Products' and any categories, tags and custom taxonomy that you use.

When you need help, go to [WooCommerce Multilingual support forum](http://wpml.org/forums/topic-tag/woocommerce/).

= Downloads =

This version of WooCommerce Multilingual works with WooCommerce 2.x.

You will also need [WPML](http://wpml.org), together with the String Translation and the Translation Management modules, which are part of the [Multilingual CMS](http://wpml.org/purchase/) package.

= Minimum versions for WPML and modules =

WooCommerce Multilingual checks that the following versions of WPML and its components are active:

* WPML Multilingual CMS       - 3.1.5
* WPML String Translation     - 2.0
* WPML Translation Managenet  - 1.9
* WPML Media                  - 2.1

Without having all these running, WooCommerce Multilingual will not be able to run.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'woocommerce-multilingual' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Translate the shop pages

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with other e-commerce plugins? =

No. This plugin is tailored for WooCommerce.

= What do I need to do in my theme? =

Make sure that your theme is not hard-coding any URL. Always use API calls to receive URLs to pages and you'll be fine.

= My checkout page displays in the same language =

In order for the checkout and store pages to appear translated, you need to create several WordPress pages and insert the WooCommerce shortcodes into them. You'll have to go over the [documentation](http://wpml.org/documentation/related-projects/woocommerce-multilingual/) and see that you performed all steps on the way.
